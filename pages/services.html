A major benefit of installing a burglar alarm on your property is that it can deter a break-in before it even happens. Burglars do not want to be caught,so will avoid difficult break-ins that are likely to attract attention. Burglar alarm systems work by sounding an alarm when movement is sensed inside your home while the alarm is set and active. <br> These systems contain lots of sensors that can detect motion, alerting you or your neighbours to a potential intruder. The sensors should be located in areas where people are more likely to try to enter your home, such as by the back door, conservatory and windows. Additional technology can be added to the system, such as window sensors that trigger the alarm when a window is opened.</span></p>
